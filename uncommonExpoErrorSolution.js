The solution involves systematic debugging to identify the root cause. 

**1. Check Minimum Requirements:**
Ensure your device or simulator meets the app's minimum requirements specified in the `app.json` or `app.config.js` file (e.g., minimum iOS or Android version).

**2. Verify Dependencies:**
Inspect your `package.json` file.  Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Run `expo install` to ensure you have all dependencies properly installed. If you made recent changes, consider running `expo prebuild` before `expo start` to clean and rebuild the project.

**3. Examine the Expo Config:**
Carefully review your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.  Look for any typos, incorrect settings, or missing keys that might lead to unexpected behavior.  Pay close attention to the `expo` section for any misconfigurations.

**4. Check the console output for other Errors:** The 'Something went wrong' error is a catch-all, often masking other more detailed errors.  Scrutinize the entire console output of Expo CLI carefully, looking for any additional error messages that might provide more specific clues.

**5. Clean and Rebuild:**
Try running `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` to clean any potentially corrupt cached files.

**6. Check for conflicting packages:** Sometimes the root of this error is a conflict between two of your dependencies. A good way to figure this out is to comment out sections of your `package.json` and to run expo start each time to see if the error is gone.

**7. Create a minimal reproducible example:** If you are still facing the error, consider creating a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problem.  This could involve creating a brand-new Expo project and gradually adding components until the error resurfaces.  This isolated project will make it easier to pinpoint the issue.
