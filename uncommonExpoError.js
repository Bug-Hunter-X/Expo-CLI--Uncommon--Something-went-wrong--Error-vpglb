This error typically occurs when you try to run an Expo managed workflow app on a device or simulator that doesn't meet the app's minimum requirements, or when there's a problem with the app's configuration or dependencies.  It's an uncommon error because Expo CLI usually provides more specific error messages. This vague message often points to underlying issues that need deeper investigation.
